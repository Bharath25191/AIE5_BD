1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:22.550
Dr. Greg: Welcome everybody to session number 3. Today we talk end to end, use cases in for stacks. We're talking about exactly how we accomplish what we hope to get out of this by the end of the 10 weeks, and we bring together everything that we've learned so far from the very 1st

2
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.960
Dr. Greg: application challenge through week one. So this is a nice little capstone for those of you. That sort of have

3
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:47.189
Dr. Greg: a little bit more work to do on get related things on dev environment setup. You're gonna have an opportunity to do that for those of you that are a bit more advanced. We've got some fun challenges in store for you guys today as well and for everybody. We've got some interesting discussion

4
00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:07.490
Dr. Greg: to continue with your breakout rooms and your journey groups around what it is you'll be building, shipping, and sharing for Demo Day. Speaking of building, shipping, and sharing, I've seen a lot of you guys crushing it in the discord way to go. Quick! Shout outs the Doc. The Oc. Here the Og.

5
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:32.050
Dr. Greg: Actually took it to the next level, played with temperature a bit and and kind of went deeper on the assignment that was shared in the build ship. Share channel. Love to see this. I also just want to do a quick shout out round the Horn. Here we saw a lot of folks sharing tomfoolery waleed. We saw Philip Kang, Philip Jones, Ben Gibbons. We saw

6
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:43.750
Dr. Greg: Kofi. We saw Kenny. What's up? Kenny Bitcoin Kenny? We saw Bd. 25, 9, 1 1. We saw Rajiv. We saw

7
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.459
Dr. Greg: Akshay and Sai tons of people sharing. I love this Curiti. We saw

8
00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:11.060
Dr. Greg: my man Fook from Vietnam. Let's go, Mahinoor Anthony, all of you guys deserve these! Shout outs the the Doc and Frickster finally got you access, my man, and then Deept. Thank you for sharing the lessons not yet learned. I'd love to see this.

9
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:24.099
Dr. Greg: How do we build scalable production rag. How do we do it with like laying chain? How do we do with dynamic Api data? All stuff that's coming soon, and then shout out to the legend, Ashwin actually putting this thing out there in public

10
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:41.529
Dr. Greg: to his audience on Linkedin. Of course we amplified it from AI Makerspace. Don't be shy everybody. Go ahead, start building that personal brand towards whatever it is that you're aiming at. Next we're here to help you amplify and help you continue to try to achieve your goals. So

11
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:58.659
Dr. Greg: as we move forward. If there's way, too many build chip shares in the Channel, I'm going to select the ones that are most interesting and relevant and detailed, and the ones that really add value for us. But I thought everybody deserved a shout out, today, great job! Keep up the good work. I'd love to see it love to see it

12
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:25.609
Dr. Greg: also. We had the whiz, building, shipping, and sharing, and I believe he mentioned this this paper and this alpaca moment that we might be in related to reasoning deep seek. r. 1 looks like an interesting paper. Maybe we'll take a closer look. Later. I suppose we'll find out and we're we're building, shipping and sharing this week with Ragus and doing agent evaluation. Join us tomorrow on Youtube and join us every Monday in the lounge to see what else

13
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:41.459
Dr. Greg: everyone else in the community is building, shipping, and sharing. Of course we don't have time to talk about that in the course, because all you guys are out there crushing it too hard, thanks to everybody for joining Vincent's deep dive today. I heard it went well, and love to hear that

14
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.740
Dr. Greg: next week he's going to be covering more

15
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.999
Dr. Greg: on what we've talked about so far more about embeddings, like words, token, sentence.

16
00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:16.840
Dr. Greg: sparse versus dense. How we can visualize these things, and this is a really interesting one. Semantic versus keyword search. This has come up in our consulting work at Am. Makerspace. Oftentimes, maybe they don't even have a keyword search in place, and they're trying to do AI. Maybe not such a good idea. Maybe you should crawl, walk, and then run. You want to talk about vector, stores. You want to talk about how to choose them. You want to talk about

17
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:33.810
Dr. Greg: more on exactly some of the underlying constructs of Langchain joining next week for his deep dive session. What time it's on the calendar. It's going to be at 9 Am. Pt. Every week on Tuesday. All right. So we are also hearing you guys from class to class

18
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:53.079
Dr. Greg: love to hear that you guys loved it, some of you. I wish I knew a little bit more about Llms, like some of my peers who have a little bit more experience. I'm sure there's more than just one person feeling this. If you're feeling that way totally all good, it's going to be a place where we all are coming together by the end of the 10 weeks

19
00:04:53.609 --> 00:05:03.730
Dr. Greg: whiz! They want more code. They want slower code, and they want us to not rush on topics, classic, classic, classic. We're gonna we're gonna do our best to

20
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:31.979
Dr. Greg: continue to try to keep it at a speed of 7. I don't think we're going to get more code or significantly slower. But we are going to do our best to keep it at 7. Let us know if you think we're at 8 or 9 more breakout time, shout out to peer supporters, love that. Unfortunately, we're trying to give you as much as we can. We're going to see how we can continue to keep that number high, that 2025Â min per breakout room session. And then we see the classic feedback coming in

21
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.419
Dr. Greg: now as well, can we release the pre-session work earlier?

22
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.169
Dr. Greg: Okay, so this is a great piece of feedback.

23
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:56.279
Dr. Greg: And I want to clarify something about pre-session work versus the work we do live during the session. If there's anything you must do in order to prepare to do the live stuff, we will send it to you.

24
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.710
Dr. Greg: Now, if

25
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.999
Dr. Greg: you're looking for something beyond the pre-session work, if you're looking for something that is exactly what we're going to do in class.

26
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.600
Dr. Greg: you're not alone.

27
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.080
Dr. Greg: I want the assignment a day before the class. I want the assignment

28
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:23.419
Dr. Greg: before the class, before the class before the class. This is something we hear a lot from students. I want to get the Prereqs installed. I want to do this. I want to do that.

29
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:44.290
Dr. Greg: Well, we're not going to give you the assignment before the class, because we've tried this in the past, and it's important to note that it really does disrupt and denigrate the breakout room experience, for the folks who are joining live, and didn't have time to look at it before we were live. So we do our best to give you all the pre work that you need. If

30
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.160
Dr. Greg: you need additional support with that pre work, then let us know. Let your peer supporter know.

31
00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:01.520
Dr. Greg: Try to figure out exactly how you can best be ready. Work with your peer supporter and your journey group. On that. We are here to work with you, but we will not be releasing the assignment early.

32
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.720
Dr. Greg: and then, thanks for everybody shouting out cursor, and maybe fleshing out some of those instructions as we add new tools.

33
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:21.150
Dr. Greg: These are things that we're constantly working on updating. So if you have specific additions, feel free to open up a Pr and let us know about it, and we will. We will always be available to check it out and try to fix it directly.

34
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.680
Dr. Greg: No assignment before class.

35
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:41.049
Dr. Greg: the setup, any setup that you need is going to be in the pre-work. So just to be like super clear, Sarah, I wonder if you can throw the free work link into the chat for session 3, so everybody can check it out. We'll always have this on the session

36
00:07:41.180 --> 00:08:04.730
Dr. Greg: sheets, and we'll be doing our best to get these session sheets out right after class for the next class. Each time it's session 3. We have to find a routine. This is just the way it goes. So I hope that that is useful to you. We are hearing you. If you have specific feedback on things we should be updating, let us know. But we cannot be releasing assignments early

37
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:12.069
Dr. Greg: as you get more comfortable with the processes of submitting assignments, it should get a lot easier. Some of the headache stuff, though

38
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.720
Dr. Greg: this was an interesting one.

39
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:30.530
Dr. Greg: Can I get sort of cleaner code instead of all this like comment, block stuff, this is something we'll take into advisement. It's not something that we've gotten feedback on before, but I do think that today you'll you'll appreciate the assignment. Whoever left this particular feedback all right.

40
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.329
Dr. Greg: and that's it on feedback. Thank you. Keep it coming.

41
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.669
Dr. Greg: This week.

42
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.470
Dr. Greg: We cover production grade rag.

43
00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:48.179
Dr. Greg: We 1st look end to end today, and we talk a little bit about Demo Day.

44
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.240
Dr. Greg: and then on Thursday we cover lang chain.

45
00:08:53.420 --> 00:09:08.160
Dr. Greg: Langchain is quite interesting now, because it's rapidly evolving, and the way we teach it, this cohort is actually going to be fundamentally different than the way we've taught it in cohorts previous. So look out for that on Thursday and look out for the pre work

46
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.600
Dr. Greg: coming after class.

47
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:25.549
Dr. Greg: Alright. So by the end of today's session, what we really want to do is we really want to understand the state of kind of production. Llm, application use cases. What's happening? And how can we

48
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.589
Dr. Greg: sort of simplify our lives around this?

49
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.740
Dr. Greg: Hopefully? AI makerspace is here to help?

50
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.950
Dr. Greg: How can we understand what to expect for Demo Day? Do some ideation.

51
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:53.410
Dr. Greg: throw down some ideas? Let us know if you're open to groups, or you want to work by yourself. And then we're actually going to bring together everything that we've built so far into sort of our 1st build challenge where we build this end to end rag application.

52
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.160
Dr. Greg: All right.

53
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.659
Dr. Greg: So let's talk about use cases.

54
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.429
Dr. Greg: AI is the new, we all know.

55
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:21.570
Dr. Greg: Andrew has been saying it since 2,017. What does that mean? Though, exactly. To be a general purpose technology. It means you're able to apply it to everything.

56
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.229
Dr. Greg: Well, you know, the 1st thing I like to sort of point out is

57
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.440
Dr. Greg: when we talk about electricity. What's the killer product that has ever been invented?

58
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.150
Dr. Greg: It's it's not exactly clear, which is tough.

59
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.079
Dr. Greg: If we think about refrigeration, it's a little bit easier.

60
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:57.510
Dr. Greg: The killer product is not the refrigerator. The killer product is Coca-cola. That's the biggest company and the most value that's ever been created based on this general purpose. Technology.

61
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:06.280
Dr. Greg: What will be the equivalent of Coca-cola to refrigeration when we think about AI. I don't know, and I don't think anybody

62
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.510
Dr. Greg: knows.

63
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.860
Dr. Greg: Maybe you guys will build it today, though

64
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.190
Dr. Greg: nobody has the right answer to what we should build. And why, in all cases

65
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.409
Dr. Greg: you can go around and you can ask, what are the top use cases for Llms today?

66
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:36.350
Dr. Greg: If you ask Gemini, it'll tell you all of these if you ask Chat Gpt.

67
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.350
Dr. Greg: Similarly it went on and on.

68
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.940
Dr. Greg: and if you ask Claude, it will

69
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.980
Dr. Greg: tell you the same stuff. So I asked, all 3 today. And I was like, Okay, okay, okay, that's fine.

70
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.989
Dr. Greg: What do you guys agree on?

71
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.729
Dr. Greg: Might as well ask AI about AI before we give our human perspective.

72
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.830
Dr. Greg: And it gave us

73
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:15.520
Dr. Greg: what follows, content creation. Okay, text generation summarization, creative writing. It gave me software development for sure coding, assistance code review and debugging technical writing. Okay.

74
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:23.790
Dr. Greg: business applications. Okay, customer support, sentiment analysis. Okay? All right.

75
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.980
Dr. Greg: Document processing.

76
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:44.139
Dr. Greg: fun, fun, stuff, education and learning, personalized tutoring. Oh, now we have more content. Creation, language, learning, research and analysis, summarization, analysis, literature, review. Okay, great

77
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.789
Dr. Greg: healthcare, more docs, more research.

78
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:57.719
Dr. Greg: language, named entity, recognition, sentiment, and it sounded a little bit nlpish kind of classic here.

79
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.783
Dr. Greg: search and retrieval. Okay,

80
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:12.000
Dr. Greg: I'm just not getting anything out of this, are you guys? Let's see, when they summarize all of these.

81
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:20.549
Dr. Greg: what what do we use? AI for? Turns out, we use it for automating repetitive tasks and extracting insights.

82
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.000
Dr. Greg: So automation and data science great.

83
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:36.550
Dr. Greg: So we should use AI to automate repetitive tasks. There's your answer. Thanks. AI. Now, this has been written about. This has been talked about. This has been

84
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:54.179
Dr. Greg: well studied, you know, if you're looking for sort of a process to go about this, you know, this is sort of one way that you could do it. I believe Andrew did describe this process in one of his Batch newsletters. But basically you can go to like a website that has all the job titles

85
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.120
Dr. Greg: and all the job titles can actually be broken down into job tasks.

86
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:08.129
Dr. Greg: and you can look at all the tasks and you can say for each of these tasks. Should I automate it, or should I augment it, or should I let the human do it?

87
00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:14.170
Dr. Greg: This is something that you could go about doing

88
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:21.049
Dr. Greg: and trying to assess value. Vcs do this kind of thing you know. And and potentially, it's quite useful.

89
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:34.109
Dr. Greg: But you know. Maybe there's an easier way like we could just ask people like, we know some people

90
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:45.189
Dr. Greg: we are consulting partners with Langchain and Llama index, and when we asked both of them, this past year in 2024

91
00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:50.089
Dr. Greg: the answer was exactly the same. That seemed pretty useful.

92
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.080
Dr. Greg: The answer was reports.

93
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.190
Dr. Greg: Huh?

94
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:03.590
Dr. Greg: The answer was searching and researching collecting data, pulling it in, summarizing it.

95
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.090
Dr. Greg: take it to the next level, and actually generating a report or filling out a form.

96
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.820
Dr. Greg: This was really the next level.

97
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.049
Dr. Greg: This is something that we've. We've done

98
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.100
Dr. Greg: a lot of stuff on Youtube with.

99
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.299
Dr. Greg: You'll notice this was kind of a

100
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:32.633
Dr. Greg: kind of a central theme in these 2 events that we did in late 2024. It really is kind of the killer. Use case today whether you like it or not.

101
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.749
Dr. Greg: searching and researching.

102
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.919
Dr. Greg: Okay, are you guys excited about that?

103
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.990
Dr. Greg: Okay, well, what do the consultants say?

104
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.839
Dr. Greg: Because if we go, and we ask Mckenzie or Kpmg. Or we ask Deloitte. I mean, they've got to have the answers right.

105
00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:04.800
Dr. Greg: Well, it turns out that if we, if we look at the most recent report from Deloitte, Q. 4, 2024, the most advanced meaning, the most scaled

106
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.240
Dr. Greg: applications are in IT.

107
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:19.160
Dr. Greg: I always make the joke here in Ohio that they still call AI it because they call everything it.

108
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.760
Dr. Greg: I'm not sure IT.

109
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.530
Dr. Greg: Is meaningful.

110
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.490
Dr. Greg: Let's dig deeper into the data here.

111
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.589
Dr. Greg: perhaps by industry. It starts to make a little bit more sense.

112
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:49.389
Dr. Greg: For instance, if we look in the consumer industry, you see a use case that was quite common to be talked about in 2024 marketing. Write me Linkedin posts. Write me email, newsletter copy. Write me sales email so I can bang out a bunch of cold calls.

113
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.690
Dr. Greg: Okay, that makes sense consumer.

114
00:16:53.530 --> 00:17:00.129
Dr. Greg: Now, if we look in financial services. Oh, look, finance is on the list that one makes sense, too.

115
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:08.250
Dr. Greg: And if we look in life, sciences, and healthcare, it's unsurprising to see R&D on the list.

116
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.789
Dr. Greg: It's pretty essential to their business, right

117
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.260
Dr. Greg: development being new drugs, new treatments, etc.

118
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.709
Dr. Greg: So what's the what's the pattern here? Well, if we consider the quote

119
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.699
Dr. Greg: taken from the Associate director of AI at a leading Healthcare Products Company

120
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:39.279
Dr. Greg: to Deloitte. In this report value creation is measured operationally by the acceleration of development pipelines.

121
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:45.369
Dr. Greg: Our focus is on development speed rather than outperforming human capabilities.

122
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.200
Dr. Greg: I like that.

123
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.769
Dr. Greg: you know. I've often talked to a lot of people that have an idea, and their idea is like.

124
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.500
Dr. Greg: I want to do this thing. And I think only AI can do it.

125
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.030
Dr. Greg: And it's like, Yeah, maybe. But also maybe not.

126
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:18.440
Dr. Greg: And it harkens back to classic AI classic, Ml. And deep learning, where, if you're not sure, you can actually do the thing, it really does add a significant amount of uncertainty and risk.

127
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.060
Dr. Greg: which is not something that the industry today has quite the appetite for.

128
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:33.150
Dr. Greg: Rather, if you focus on just doing what humans can already do, but faster.

129
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.309
Dr. Greg: even if you need to take their job and

130
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.759
Dr. Greg: break it down into a series of tasks.

131
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:48.189
Dr. Greg: For instance, let's say you work at a market research firm.

132
00:18:48.500 --> 00:19:05.290
Dr. Greg: And you need to go. And you need to search and research the same numbers because they change every day from the stock market. And all of this stuff you're pulling in and you're analyzing it. And you're synthesizing it. And you're writing a report on it on sort of a weekly basis.

133
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.809
Dr. Greg: That's a really great use case for AI.

134
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.670
Dr. Greg: Does that analyst really want to do that? Anyways.

135
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.360
Dr. Greg: if we can find the intersection of what people really don't want to do.

136
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.599
Dr. Greg: and the stuff people are already good at.

137
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.840
Dr. Greg: and the stuff that moves the needle for the organization that's a win-win.

138
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.089
Dr. Greg: This idea of time is something we've already talked about. Right?

139
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:39.010
Dr. Greg: We talked about Nitin, and when he built sales. Buddy, this is the homepage about creating time for your enterprise. Sales Rep.

140
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:45.439
Dr. Greg: We talked about publicus, and it's about not wasting time on Rfps.

141
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:55.060
Dr. Greg: It seems that AI creates value when it frees up humans time.

142
00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.780
Dr. Greg: Now, how does it tee up humans. Time.

143
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.010
Dr. Greg: One of the questions that we talked a lot about last year

144
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.910
Dr. Greg: is, we got this idea like.

145
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.829
Dr. Greg: are these apps? Are these Lm applications that were built. Are they just chat bots.

146
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.279
Dr. Greg: And as we'll talk about today like.

147
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:29.070
Dr. Greg: well sometimes, but like chat bots are just interfaces, they're just a way to interface with

148
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:38.599
Dr. Greg: an AI system, and the AI system doesn't just have to be at the level of the individual who you're interfacing with. It could be at the level of the enterprise.

149
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.710
Dr. Greg: And this is where we're headed towards these enterprise workflows.

150
00:20:45.040 --> 00:21:09.989
Dr. Greg: We're headed towards a future where? And you can see this early right. Now, this is from today. This is from one of the Vcs. That was at the Llama Index Ragathon. That was a judge when we were running this Packathon with llama Index in September, and he put out, you know this sort of enterprise, layer. We can look at Agent AI by Hubspot or salesforce agent force. This is the kind of thing

151
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.530
Dr. Greg: that enterprise is thinking about.

152
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.960
Dr. Greg: And you know

153
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:41.689
Dr. Greg: I wrote about this in the session sheet, and you know my bad. I released this only today. But I'd like to get the most updated information. If you think about what the Enterprise leaders, people like Mark Benioff and Ceos at his level are thinking about. They're thinking about this future of enterprise workflows. And I love this quote from the CEO of Uipath, one of the oldest

154
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:48.670
Dr. Greg: AI companies. They're a robotic process Automation company that's entering their second

155
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:57.160
Dr. Greg: sort of breadth of company life with AI and I, like Daniel Dines, their CEO,

156
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:07.529
Dr. Greg: where he imagines this future, where everybody's in front of the computer, they're just waiting for emails to come into their inbox. It's an email. It's not a chat interface.

157
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:32.239
Dr. Greg: And the email says, Hey, please validate this, please validate this. I need this information. I need this. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. The Enterprise orchestration layer. We'll talk about orchestration with Langchain on Thursday. The orchestration layer is thinking end to end as many people, not just one as many interfaces, not just one.

158
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.830
Dr. Greg: Okay.

159
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.910
Dr. Greg: So if you want to make money, that's dope.

160
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.359
Dr. Greg: Maybe you should think at the Enterprise level.

161
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:45.090
Dr. Greg: But just because it makes someone money doesn't mean that you'll care at all.

162
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.650
Dr. Greg: Which is important because we're here to talk about you.

163
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.910
Dr. Greg: We're here to talk about Demo Day.

164
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:59.160
Dr. Greg: We're gonna talk about. What's a problem that you're genuinely interested in solving.

165
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.659
Dr. Greg: that you actually want to share

166
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.700
Dr. Greg: with either a company or some community that you're involved in.

167
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:13.199
Dr. Greg: And we'll talk about how to build these solutions, and we'll talk about the AI engineering and and

168
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.630
Dr. Greg: all of that.

169
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.180
Dr. Greg: That's the whole course.

170
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.910
Dr. Greg: But it's important to align our aim, 2

171
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.929
Dr. Greg: building, shipping, and sharing prototypes. So we're going to do every week.

172
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:33.589
Dr. Greg: Your Demo Day Project is a unique example to ask yourself, like like, do I care?

173
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.740
Dr. Greg: And if you don't care, your project will suck.

174
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.749
Dr. Greg: We try to make the projects that we give you guys in class fun

175
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.910
Dr. Greg: because we want to care about them.

176
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.400
Dr. Greg: It's not a secret.

177
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:56.840
Dr. Greg: Do you care about the audience? Do you care about the community? If you do dope?

178
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.480
Dr. Greg: If you don't.

179
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.890
Dr. Greg: You're gonna struggle.

180
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:13.259
Dr. Greg: Remember, we have this Gpt that we built out. It basically does what I used to do with students. Where do you work? We could build something for that. What do you like to do outside of work?

181
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.020
Dr. Greg: We we could definitely build something for that.

182
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.810
Dr. Greg: So all of you are going to come up with an idea.

183
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.749
Dr. Greg: Some of you are gonna have a team.

184
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.940
Dr. Greg: And then we're gonna have

185
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:44.250
Dr. Greg: demo day. And it's gonna be great. Okay, it's gonna be live. We're gonna get a lot of people in the room. It's gonna be sick. I just want to take a couple of minutes, though I want to talk. I want to bring Sriracha up to the stage, because

186
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:54.439
Dr. Greg: when we do a production like Demo Day, I want you guys to know this. Now, it's actually not just getting an app done. It's like a whole production.

187
00:24:54.924 --> 00:25:12.649
Dr. Greg: Sarah, what goes into a production like Demo Day that presenters should know about. And maybe you can think about all of the work we do on Youtube live. You can think about your time back at deep learning when you were running the very, very large events for them.

188
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:19.299
Dr. Greg: All presenters have this sort of production layer they have to deal with. Can you tell us about that?

189
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:34.859
Seraacha: Yeah, sure thing, Greg, thank you. Well, hey, everybody. Yes, Greg is talking about production, and I will tell you I love this aspect of events and putting on live streams for folks, especially Demo Day. It's my favorite day of the cohort so very excited.

190
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:50.750
Seraacha: So when we think about production, you're gonna think about all the minute details from we're gonna from organizing a script on how you actually present your demo live to an actual dress rehearsal which you'll do with all of us

191
00:25:50.750 --> 00:26:15.409
Seraacha: down to the minutes of how much time you have to actually present and answer questions from judges. So there's all these little pieces that go into it, and as far as what we do on Youtube live, Dr. Greg and whiz! They get a script every single week. We do a rehearsal, I review their content, their slides. I get a link for the notebook that we share. So there's all these little pieces that we'll be

192
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:26.419
Seraacha: walking with you through this process. The closer we get to Demo Day, and we're gonna make sure that like I said, you're gonna have a rehearsal. You'll have time to prepare, and you'll also be able to get feedback

193
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:33.599
Seraacha: from your peers and your peer supporter on the project that you'll be presenting. Did you want me to go into any more details, Greg?

194
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:50.480
Dr. Greg: No, that's pretty good. I mean, if you have questions, feel free to ask them now, or ask them to your peer supporter. But you know it's it's it's little things that you guys don't think about. Right, Sarah. I mean, it's like, it's like, Can you see my screen? Oh, oh, my God! You know it's like can you hear me?

195
00:26:51.530 --> 00:27:06.789
Dr. Greg: You know, and it's like, it's like all these little things that we don't really have time to think about when we're focused in on the technical details and on the jargon and on the thing we built. And on the way we present it all that matters.

196
00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:19.919
Dr. Greg: But it's important to make sure that you've got your stuff. If you've got team members, they've got their stuff, and it really is a genuine production here at Am Makerspace. We'll go ahead and take a question from you. Rajesh, what's what's up

197
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:30.230
Dr. Greg: you're you're on mute classically still, muted Rajesh.

198
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:45.440
Rajesh Iyer: Oh, sorry. Yeah. 2 questions, actually, one is, when do we get to start our project? Is there a specific date by which we should get started. And you know, start preparing for it. I mean, you know.

199
00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:48.299
Rajesh Iyer: that is one. And then second is,

200
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:57.330
Rajesh Iyer: how do we choose our groups? I mean, should we work as an individual, or should we, you know, make start making our groups right now? Or.

201
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:09.920
Dr. Greg: Perfect questions. Perfect segue, Rajesh. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually hop into breakout rooms now. And and we're gonna try to set you up to be able to quickly fill out this form.

202
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:16.080
Dr. Greg: And the form goes like this. Do you have a project idea? If so, what's your idea. Do you have a team?

203
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:41.769
Dr. Greg: If yes, let us know. If not, are you open to working on a team? And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna try to with this cohort. Give you guys additional support with teaming, maybe do a little teaming mixer within the next few weeks, and then for the Midterm project. We want you guys to basically prototype a 1st cut at your Demo Day project.

204
00:28:41.770 --> 00:29:07.469
Dr. Greg: and we'll sort of walk you through all those details and do it with the team you plan on doing it with. So we're trying to set this up so where you guys can sort of build it, and then work on it and keep refining it over those 5 weeks. Refine the product, refine the production value, and get to know your team better and better, and then we'll we'll sort of do our best to fill up the room full of cool people that could, you know, give you money, give you jobs, give you cool things in the future.

205
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.649
Dr. Greg: So with that.

206
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:15.170
Dr. Greg: what I'd like to do is I'd like to actually let you guys spend some time together with each other. And

207
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:23.430
Dr. Greg: if you don't have an idea, that's okay. Okay, it's not. We're not forcing you into this right now. What we want you to do is we want you to just talk about

208
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.829
Dr. Greg: what you're building now. You you may have started to do this in session one.

209
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.069
Dr. Greg: and I'll let your peer supporters and your journey groups continue the discussion here.

210
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:42.530
Dr. Greg: But we're more interested in what you're actually building now, and and how you sort of plan on leveraging the tools in the course

211
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.810
Dr. Greg: to take it to the next level.

212
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:52.309
Dr. Greg: Or maybe you're not building anything yet, but you want to build something for your organization or for your future organization.

213
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.580
Dr. Greg: What is that thing?

214
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.539
Dr. Greg: Can you describe it?

215
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:16.780
Dr. Greg: Maybe your journey group can help. Everybody's going to get about 2Â min to talk about this, and your peer supporters are going to lead with skin in the game. They're going to tell you what they're building. They're going to tell you how they're trying to take it to the next level. Want to get in the habit of building, shipping, and sharing, telling people about it, and of doing it with a community.

216
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.000
Dr. Greg: So we're going to spend some time together.

217
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.910
Dr. Greg: We hope this is useful, and

218
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:27.389
Dr. Greg: we will also drop the link in the chat right now

219
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:32.370
Dr. Greg: to the preferences for Demo Day. If you'd like to

220
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:43.839
Dr. Greg: go ahead and fill this out, live while you're in that room. That would be super helpful. This won't be a graded assignment. We just want to know how we can help you out.

221
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:59.600
Dr. Greg: So we're going to go ahead and open them up for 25Â min. When we come back, we're going to spend the second half of class totally focused on infrastructure, doing our build challenge and really digging into the details of what end to end means from an AI engineering perspective.

222
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:11.780
Dr. Greg: I need access access denied this new Google form setup. We're gonna get it figured out. Give me just 1Â min after you get into your room. You will have access, I promise. All right, let's open them up.

223
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.109
Dr. Greg: Before we go to the break. I'd like to invite everybody to just

224
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:31.950
Dr. Greg: smash the chat with any great ideas, so that you can make it easy for folks in the cohort to follow up with you. If they're super interested in your idea.

225
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.539
Dr. Greg: And hopefully, we can create some collisions, some connections.

226
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:55.599
Dr. Greg: But with that we're going to take a quick 5Â min, break it out, shake it out if you want to stick around and hang out. We're around, but we're going to do a quick 5. We'll be back at 8 0. 3 pm. Eastern 5 0. 3 Pm. Pacific to dig into the second half of class infrastructure. Let's go.

227
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:29.939
Dr. Greg: and we are back from break. I love the ideas coming in. We will share a list of ideas with everybody in the discord, also in emails, and make sure that you guys sort of are able to have transparency through what some of the ideas are in the cohort. If you guys want to definitely work alone. We won't necessarily share your stuff. So also for those of you that you know know exactly what you want to do, and and kind of how to do it. Just quick reminder. Demo day is required for certification. So hopefully, you know, we can get you all aligned towards

228
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:36.230
Dr. Greg: getting certified towards nailing the demo day and towards really achieving. You know your goals in 2025,

229
00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:57.840
Dr. Greg: all right. So part of that. And a big part of that we're not going to spend this much time on sort of ideation in general. We're not going to spend this much time on product management in general. This is an AI engineering course. However, the best AI engineers, as we mentioned, they are the ones thinking about what we should build and why. And they're just cranking out prototypes. So this is the the sort of flavor we want to give you guys.

230
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:13.019
Dr. Greg: Now let's talk about the details. This is where AI engineering comes in when it's time to build solutions. And AI engineering, of course, is the industry relevant set of skills that data, science and engineering teams need

231
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:19.629
Dr. Greg: to successfully build, deploy, operate, and improve Lm applications in broad.

232
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.930
Dr. Greg: We are using the Llm. App stack to sort of learn our way into this.

233
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:31.829
Dr. Greg: And this is the stack that's based on the design pattern of in context learning.

234
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.320
Dr. Greg: We're going to use this stack a lot.

235
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:41.649
Dr. Greg: I encourage all of you to be able to sort of draw out

236
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:53.840
Dr. Greg: some kind of stack on a whiteboard for your future endeavors. It doesn't have to be this stack with these 3 stages, but it can be, and it's a great starting point to use

237
00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:04.929
Dr. Greg: in this one. From a 16 Z. We have embedding, we have retrieval, and we have inference, so we can look at the whole stack as we will. As we continue our builds

238
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:16.750
Dr. Greg: orchestration in the middle, we sort of have the ui over here on the left we have the back end with, you know, caching and logging and validation, this sort of

239
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:30.210
Dr. Greg: guardrails making sure that the stuff that comes out of the Llm is the stuff that we can serve to our users. And then, of course, the contextual data piece on top putting context in through data that we chop up into

240
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:47.059
Dr. Greg: vectors that we then put into a database, we may plug into external Apis as well. So this piece is where really the rag comes in. We start to get that agentic behavior in the Apis, and we want to make sure that we have that user interface. This chat bot interface.

241
00:34:47.400 --> 00:35:00.379
Dr. Greg: And then this kind of ability to actually host all the stuff we need on the back end. And as we'll see one of the things that's so interesting that you guys that are maybe going super advanced today

242
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.000
Dr. Greg: might notice is that

243
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:23.260
Dr. Greg: we can actually host entire applications. This is what we would do with something like lang graph server. Part of now lang graph platform, formerly lang serve. And the back end of that is actually the back end that we have is a challenge for you guys to build today. But for the vast majority of you, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take

244
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.310
Dr. Greg: this challenge.

245
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.180
Dr. Greg: Then we're going to take the pythonic rag work that we did.

246
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.870
Dr. Greg: And we're gonna put them together.

247
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.540
Dr. Greg: That's it.

248
00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:40.729
Dr. Greg: We're going to put a chain, let front end on a rag out.

249
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.259
Dr. Greg: and it's important to understand, like

250
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:50.599
Dr. Greg: what is chain lit and what does it do? Exactly. Well, you know it kind of is

251
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.259
Dr. Greg: bit like streamlit python programming. Ui.

252
00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:11.240
Dr. Greg: it's a front end. It. It allows your users to sort of mess with the prompt. It allows them to really play with things. It allows you to actually do some AI engineering through prompting directly into the Ui

253
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:21.900
Dr. Greg: and chain. Let's pretty cool. You know, we we've gotten to know the guys that built chainlit. They're actually building another platform. That's more of a competitor with Lang Smith, now called literal AI.

254
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:28.640
Dr. Greg: But you know it was pretty cool to hear from Dan that they had someone deploy an app that a million users per week

255
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.750
Dr. Greg: we're using.

256
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:38.339
Dr. Greg: So I mean, you can use this just probably best if you're like a startup outfit.

257
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:45.349
Dr. Greg: And you guys don't have specific things that you must do for enterprise. It's very simple python syntax, as you've seen.

258
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.110
Dr. Greg: And

259
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:55.200
Dr. Greg: importantly, when you set up a Ui, you have to think, what does my user put in? What do I give them out?

260
00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:07.309
Dr. Greg: This input. Output is quite important. When we talk about something like prompting, we say, specify the input output. We talk about fine tuning. We can fine tune exactly this, input that output.

261
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:14.000
Dr. Greg: And it makes you think about what you want in your product. It makes you think about

262
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.750
Dr. Greg: all the stuff you want to provide your user.

263
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:32.690
Dr. Greg: You wanted to have fast response times. You want it to be accurate. You want it to be low cost. You want it to be scalable. There are some things that are baked into chain lit that maybe you didn't look too closely at during the challenge that we encourage you guys to look at today. So it's it's Async out of the box.

264
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:44.170
Dr. Greg: And importantly, this just means that we are leveraging this idea that

265
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:50.759
Dr. Greg: we're not getting stopped up because of this sequential operation

266
00:37:51.410 --> 00:38:03.719
Dr. Greg: thing that happens in synchronous environments like when we're dealing with sending a bunch of responses, we don't get to decide how long it takes to get a response back.

267
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:17.999
Dr. Greg: So we send a request. We get a response. How long does it take to get that response? We don't get to decide. So it's better just like when you're calling a customer service line to ask for a call back

268
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:25.610
Dr. Greg: and the callback is executed. Once the response is ready, you get the call back.

269
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:31.690
Dr. Greg: And and so this idea of of not being synchronous, but being asynchronous is something you're going to see everywhere

270
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.129
Dr. Greg: all the apps you build. It's out of the box everywhere.

271
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.190
Dr. Greg: It's not something special.

272
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.179
Dr. Greg: You're going to see it in the code.

273
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.729
Dr. Greg: and you should kind of know what it does.

274
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:51.159
Dr. Greg: There's other things that chain let does out of the box that other applications are going to do out of the box, too. Things like user sessions.

275
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.539
Dr. Greg: Are you serving more than one user?

276
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:04.389
Dr. Greg: If so, like, you need to communicate with each of them separately. You can't be like confusing conversations.

277
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.049
Dr. Greg: And those user sessions.

278
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.049
Dr. Greg: They're pretty easy to start on. Chat. Start.

279
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:19.400
Dr. Greg: The other thing you'll notice, especially for those of you kind of less familiar with python is that you'll notice

280
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.169
Dr. Greg: some specific python syntax.

281
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:30.529
Dr. Greg: You'll notice methods which are functions associated with classes or objects.

282
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:37.290
Dr. Greg: And you'll notice decorators sort of the function within a function.

283
00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.380
Dr. Greg: These decorators play an important role.

284
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.629
Dr. Greg: We can do lots of stuff with them.

285
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.200
Dr. Greg: You'll see them.

286
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.939
Dr. Greg: This little at sign indicates the decorator.

287
00:39:52.070 --> 00:40:00.689
Dr. Greg: and there are decorators that you can use that go pretty far beyond, on message and on chat. Start

288
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.089
Dr. Greg: wiz will talk about some of this in his demo.

289
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:11.269
Dr. Greg: We're going to use models that we are probably pretty familiar with already for a Mini text 3 embedding small.

290
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.749
Dr. Greg: We're going to leverage the recent paper on Reasoning from Deepseq.

291
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:25.979
Dr. Greg: We're going to load it. We're going to chunk it. We're going to embed it. We're going to store it. We're going to do it just the way that we did it with the Pythonic rag setup. So we're going to take our app stack.

292
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.689
Dr. Greg: We're gonna take this standard setup from our challenge.

293
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:38.590
Dr. Greg: We're going to integrate the Pythonic rag. And then we're going to have a new application that we can chat with.

294
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.370
Dr. Greg: The app stack looks like this.

295
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.360
Dr. Greg: Wiz has created a custom diagram shows you exactly what's going on that looks like this.

296
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.359
Dr. Greg: And he's gonna walk us through exactly what's going on

297
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.430
Dr. Greg: end to end when we build a prototype

298
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.146
Dr. Greg: just like this one whiz over to you.

299
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.610
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Oh, yeah, okay, so we're gonna start.

300
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:09.390
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: as we usually do with the actual

301
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:25.599
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: assignment. So this is the assignment. You're going to see that there's this big note, and there's only one thing that you need to do from the actual assignment page in the Github Repository, and that is to

302
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:40.650
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: CD. To not the current Github Repository, and then clone this new repo. This is extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely important.

303
00:41:40.650 --> 00:42:10.500
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Please make sure that you do not do this in your current repository you will have a headache that will need to be resolved by us, and then we will also have everyone's going to get headaches. So the big thing is, if you just copy and paste this, it's going to automatically take care of that for you. But if not, just make sure you're not creating like a sub repository. Get will let you do this, and it's perfectly manageable, but it will complicate things for your future. So just do that, and it'll be great.

304
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:18.430
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: This new repository is basically a redux of the challenge, except it's going to be a little bit

305
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:32.349
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: a little bit different, because we're going to use python. So instead of just using open AI, we're always using python. But the pythonic implementation of rag as opposed to just wrapping the Chat Gpt Endpoint.

306
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:57.300
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: So there's a couple of things that we want to think about or consider. Number one. You'll notice that we have this. Read me this, read me, has this strange blob at the top. If you look at it in your editor, you're going to see this. We have to have that. Please leave that. Please do not change it. You can change the values in here all you'd like, except for this one and

307
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:05.039
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: other than that you can change things how you would, how you would like. But if you don't have this, the huggy face will not work, and that will be sad.

308
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:14.949
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Next we have. If you want to run this locally, we are using UV. So someone was mentioning earlier about this idea that like, Hey, we actually don't have.

309
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:39.939
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: You know we don't have a, you know package set up to make things nice and clean. We have that with UV. So the piproject Toml is going to have exactly the dependencies pinned to exactly the versions they should be pinned to, as well as what version of Python you have. All of this is handled through UV in order to get started with this

310
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.649
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: you have to do is run UV sync.

311
00:43:42.660 --> 00:44:04.989
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: and then you can run UV run, and then whatever you'd like to run. In this case. Chain lit, run apppy. That's going to be a local instance of chainlit. So this is not going to be something that I'm going to recommend that you do just use Docker. But if you really want to run it without docker, this is how you do that. Uvsync is basically just saying, Hey.

312
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:15.469
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: collect all this stuff into dot, you know.vn, so we can use it for later. Then we have this diagram. This diagram has like a ton of stuff going on, but it's not

313
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:37.620
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: as complicated as it as it might look, due to the amount of lines that that appear. So 1st of all, we have some stuff that is on Openai's side of the aisle. Then we have some stuff that's on our users, you know, side of the aisle, and then we have our application. Our application is going to be hosted on a hugging face space

314
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:42.220
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: that space is going to have some secrets and secrets and environment variables.

315
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.980
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: The huggy face space will launch or run a docker container

316
00:44:47.130 --> 00:45:02.629
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: which is going to propagate these secrets. So now our secrets are in this docker container, and then the docker container is what's running. The chainlit instance chain lit is technically split between a back end and a front end. There you go, classic web stuff.

317
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:30.819
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: All of this is just showing you what happens whenever stuff moves through the application. So when we 1st create our app we go to on chat start and we ask for a file. The user's input is required to progress to the next step. Once we do, we process that text file. Then we're going to build the vector database from a list of text chunks which we saw last week with the pythonic rag. This is going to leverage text embedding 3 small.

318
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.969
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Then we're going to use our retrieval, augmented pipeline which you're going to see in a second.

319
00:45:35.970 --> 00:46:00.129
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Then we wait. We just chill. We just chill here. We do nothing. We just chill here waiting for input. If we get text, input, we're going to receive a message. So the on message section of our application will trigger. This is going to run our pipeline, which is going to involve accessing both Gbt. 4 0. Mini and text embedding 3 small. And then we're going to stream the response straight back to the text box which is going to be pushed

320
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:09.699
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: forward to the user. So that's all that's happening here. A lot of boxes, a lot of lines, but very straightforward flow. It's going to look even simpler. Once we're in the application.

321
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:33.879
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: We have the full instructions on how to build the Channel application. If, in case you want to build your own as well as a few questions. You know, why? Why do we care about streaming is a question, why do we care about user session is a question. And then, finally, we're going to play around with this app on the new deep. Seek r. 1 paper and ask some questions, and then we're going to determine. Hey, is this rag application. Passenger Vibe. Check

322
00:46:33.950 --> 00:47:01.000
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: right or not. You'll also notice at the bottom of this assignment that we have this challenge mode which is to recreate chainlet or whatever version you want, basically recreate the ability to chat with the rag pipeline, using fastapi and either react or whatever Js framework you consider your favorite at the moment. This is. This is how these kinds of challenge modes are going to look

323
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:24.119
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: through the cohort. There's no real guidance here. It's just a task. It's up to you to figure out how you want to accomplish this task, what tools you want to use, how you're going to achieve the goal. It is definitely possible. But it's totally up to you how you navigate that. So this is why it is a challenge and not just another part of the code assignment. Okay?

324
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.490
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: So

325
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:39.739
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: in order to make this all happen which we have working here just to just to show you the the final product right where we can upload our text or Pdf file to begin. Once we do, we can ask questions. That's great. We can ask

326
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:54.629
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: complex questions like, what is the difference between Deepseq, r. 1 and Deepseq, R. 1 0, which we get a great answer for. Leave this up to you guys in your breakout rooms. We could also ask really advanced questions, like, What what is this paper about.

327
00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:19.410
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: you know? Which is a extremely complex question. I'm sure it's going to be difficult. Oh, Whoa! What's this? Right? So this is the this is something that's worth discussing in your breakout rooms is why you think that something like this is not answerable, but something that looks certainly technically more complex is quite, quite answerable. But this is this is running on huggy face right now.

328
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:49.260
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Right? So we saw, we can set it a query. And all that we're doing is we're creating this apppy right? So I'm not going to go through the process of showing you exactly how you copy all the files over into your local. That's something that you've already done in the challenge. So we're not going to belabor the point here, but I am going to walk you through the actual appy implementation. So we're going to look at it in Github because it hurts my eyes less. And we're going to see

329
00:48:49.260 --> 00:49:05.990
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: what this is trying to do. 1st of all, we have a big wall of imports. We have some important ones like, you know, stuff from chainlit. Our AI makerspace rag implementation. We also have some fun python ones, which is just basically typing in OS.

330
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:32.450
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: We have exactly from the notebook last week a system template and user prompt template. This is the same ones that we saw. There you go, and then we have our retrieval augmented Qa. Pipeline, which we saw at the end of the notebook last week. Basically, all this is going to do is that it's going to be initialized with some Llm and some vector database retriever. And then it is going to be.

331
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:41.659
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: have the method, a run pipeline, which is going to take some query. And then it's going to do rag with the query, right? It's going to build a context list from the query

332
00:49:41.750 --> 00:50:00.599
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: specifically, for you know, top K documents. Then, of course, we're going to shove that into a new line separated string. We're going to format that into our prompt. And then we're going to use this fun, little Async, def generate response Async, for chunk in the stream.

333
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:26.939
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Yield, Chunk. So if you if you know python, you're probably like nice, I know what's happening. If you don't. Basically, this is a generator, what's going to happen is that we're going to be able to pull this generator. And every time it's updated, we're going to get the next response. So you'll notice in our return, we actually return the generator as the response. So we have to make sure that when we build logic to consume the response.

334
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:35.269
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: we understand that this is a generator. All that a generator does is basically say you can call next on it.

335
00:50:35.270 --> 00:51:03.649
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: right? And you're going to get the next bit of response. This is the streaming response that we're talking about, which I'll leave to you guys to figure out why it's important to have streaming in the 1st place in the breakout rooms. We have our text splitter easy, peasy. Okay? Then we have this process file function. This is going to unsurprisingly process a file. We're going to process both text files and Pdf files. So we ensure that we have that set up.

336
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:13.470
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: And then we have this fun little notation here. Right? So so far, this is just kind of regular old python. Nothing nothing crazy is happening here. Then we have this

337
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:34.500
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: at Cl on Chat. Start for those of you who understand all of what I've been talking about so far. That's great. I hope you're enjoying the re-exploration of these concepts for those of you who don't. This is called a decorator. All it does is it decorates the function. We can think of a decorator as something like a function that wraps another function.

338
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:59.410
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: And the reason decorators are so handy is that they have some kind of you know implementation that does a lot of fun things for us. So instead of having to interact with the front end or send messages or send events and listen for events. And all this other stuff we just wrap with on chat start. And what this is going to, I mean, the English works. Very well.

339
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:20.100
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: right. This is going to run this function when the chat starts, or on the start of the chat. Right there you go. So that's the power of decorators is that they help us do. It's a very useful pattern. You're going to see this if you try the challenge mode with fastapi, which also uses decorators to great effect.

340
00:52:20.386 --> 00:52:29.839
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: On chat start, what are we going to do? Well, we're gonna start with no files. And then, while files are are none. While there's no files. We're just gonna sit there waiting

341
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:54.799
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: every 180 seconds. We're going to say, Hey, give us a file right over and over again until we get the file. Once we have the file we're going to go ahead, and this while Loop will no longer be, you know, this will no longer resolve to. True, it's going to be false, so we'll carry on. We'll extract the actual contents of our file. We'll send a message. So people know what we're doing, which is we're processing the file.

342
00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:16.089
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Then we're going to use process file. We're going to say how many chunks. We're processing. We're going to build our vector database with those chunks. And then we're going to set up our Llm, we're going to set up our retrieval augmented Qa pipeline, which, remember, takes that vector dB, retriever and an Llm. And then we're going to say, Hey, we're done. You can start asking questions. And then we're going to set

343
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:36.589
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: the user session chain variable to the constructed retrieval augmented. Qa pipeline. This is user sessions, right? Which is very straightforward. It's just things that are specific to this user's session. Right? So, for instance, right now.

344
00:53:36.850 --> 00:54:02.299
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: if I go back to our application, and I and I, you know, want to upload this deep, seek r, 1 Pdf, to process so we can ask questions. There we go. I can say, you know what is. What is. Rl, we get some kind of answer. That's great, right. But if I want to go ahead and open this in a new window right here, you'll notice I don't see any of that stuff right? Because I'm in a new session now.

345
00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:09.849
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: So this is the kind of reason we care about user sessions. Right? We want each user to have their own

346
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:13.900
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: unique interaction with our application. Okay.

347
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:40.970
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: then, we have on message, you know, just you can imagine this is going to occur when we get a message or on a message, right? So this is going to happen. Whenever I send a message, I'm going to send it this one, because it's not going to definitely fail. Right? So we say things like, you know, what is sft. It might not know this. Oh, it knew it. Great job. So on. Message was triggered. Once I hit enter on that message perfect. Okay.

348
00:54:41.390 --> 00:55:04.840
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: And what is it going to do? Well, all it's going to do is it's going to grab our chain, which, remember, is our retrieval augmented Qa. Pipeline from the user session. So it's going to get it. It was stored here. It was picked up over here, and then it's going to just await that chain, a run, pipeline, to give us this result. Object. All this is cool. It's.

349
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:34.369
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: you know, it's using Async pattern, right? Which is which is handy because it's fast. And again, that's up to you guys to talk about in the in the breakout rooms a little bit, and then we get this result, which we know is going to have a generator in the response field, and then we can just sit there waiting for new tokens with the Stream token method. There you go, and then we can send the final message back, you might ask yourself, Well, why do we need to do this user set stuff right?

350
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:49.840
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: And this is basically because if we don't, Python will have forgotten that we set this variable up right. We did all this work here. It will have forgotten it whenever we call it with a message, because this is only valid in the scope of this function.

351
00:55:49.940 --> 00:56:10.330
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: That's the whole thing, guys. It's not that crazy. And again, I hope you've enjoyed for some of you a trip down Memory Lane for others who are just getting into this stuff. These are patterns that we're going to see constantly throughout the next few weeks together, and once you get into, you know.

352
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:23.770
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: you know, working on this in an AI engineering role, this is all you're going to deal with all the time. But this is your your brief introduction. With that we're gonna go ahead and pass you back to Greg, who will get us into our breakout rooms.

353
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:32.430
Dr. Greg: Awesome. Thanks, wiz! Hey? One quick question, wiz! Is this production ready?

354
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:58.620
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: It sure isn't. This is a prototype. Yes, our little Python library is not, you know, designed for scale. Remember, it's using a vector. Database. That's just a python dictionary. So if we have even a thousand vectors, we're going to start to see some slowdowns, but it is working, and it is prototyped.

355
00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.040
Dr. Greg: Right.

356
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:18.220
Chris "The Wiz" Alexiuk: Hands on it. More importantly, your users can vibe check it? To answer Hugh's question, really quick. This is the latest chainlit code. The way we set up the UV environment is to circumvent the web socket. Issue big, thanks to Mike Dean for troubleshooting that for us and getting it in there! So there you go!

357
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:42.669
Dr. Greg: Yes, yes, awesome. So yeah, we will cover more on what production ready means as we talk about scale. But hey, I mean, come on, how many users do you really have? Come on? You know it's like you can probably get this thing working for a couple of people and see if it passes the vibe check on the people that do it today. Now we're gonna go to breakout rooms, for those of you that are engaged want to do this are in it.

358
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:49.100
Dr. Greg: Heck! Yeah, that's what we're talking about, if you're like, oh, my God! I still don't have

359
00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:54.380
Dr. Greg: my basic setup ready, and I would rather work on that

360
00:57:54.790 --> 00:58:11.240
Dr. Greg: Todd Llm. Is available. Duke is available. They are in. Come here for one on one support. You can jump in or let your peer supporter know we're here to help you out. Meet you where you are advanced folks get after it. Go advance. We got 25Â min. We'll see you back to close out session. 3. Enjoy the time together, guys

361
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.440
Dr. Greg: pythonic rag in chain. Let's go

362
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:25.689
Dr. Greg: now that we're back from breakout rooms. It's time to wrap.

363
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:30.630
Dr. Greg: This was session 3. This was end to end

364
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:35.539
Dr. Greg: brag. This was sort of bringing everything we've learned together together.

365
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:41.780
Dr. Greg: and hopefully aligning us in a really positive way towards the future. Now

366
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:59.369
Dr. Greg: we saw that in industry, you know, we're searching. We're researching. We're writing reports. We're filling out forms. This is sort of the state of the art. We're going to take the data that you guys gave us about use cases. We're going to share it in discord. Tag. You guys hopefully make some collisions, some connections there.

367
00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:08.330
Dr. Greg: Don't forget Demo Day is going to be the talk of your life. Ped talk level status. We're going to keep pushing this.

368
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:22.920
Dr. Greg: And we're going to keep getting you guys prepared for a high level of production value. Maybe you're not truly acting. Maybe it's not fully embodied. We are virtual, after all, but we are going to try to take it really seriously.

369
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:43.599
Dr. Greg: Now, end to end is something we'll continue to talk about production grade is something we'll continue to talk about. This is a stack we saw today, and that we've seen so far that you can pick up, and you can just quick prototype stuff, and you can get people using it. You can ship it into people's hands. You can get feedback from your users. There's nothing stopping you

370
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:51.790
Dr. Greg: today from shipping a rag application on Monday to people at your company or to people in your communities.

371
00:59:52.310 --> 01:00:03.019
Dr. Greg: That's where we wanted to get you by session. 3. Now, do you understand? Every single aspect? Probably not. Are we going to go deeper for the next 9 weeks? Yes, we are.

372
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.630
Dr. Greg: On Thursday we cover lang chain.

373
01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.390
Dr. Greg: We talk about exactly how to implement it today, based on the latest and greatest.

374
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:26.900
Dr. Greg: Actually, we're going to leverage laying graph, not laying chain. We'll talk about the deets on Thursday, and and don't forget as you're thinking about teams. Do think about pairing yourself with somebody who complements you like the whiz and I, we don't have the same skill set.

375
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:41.390
Dr. Greg: If you can find somebody similar in this cohort that you can really really jive with and Vibe with. That's going to be a winning combination rather than a bunch of you know, Steve Wozniaks up on stage, although we love you guys, too. That's how it turns out.

376
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:46.000
Dr. Greg: Okay, that's it for session. 3. 1 more thing.

377
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:58.860
Dr. Greg: Please. Please let us know what you thought about today. Let us know how we can improve for future cohorts. We're always working on trying to take this to the next level. Improve the processes, improve your experience. Let us know what you thought.

378
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:01.469
Dr. Greg: and 2Â min on the clock.

379
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.800
Dr. Greg: We'll close it out right after feedback.

380
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:26.939
Dr. Greg: Thank you. Everybody for providing feedback on today. Thanks for the great discussions going on in the chat. I love these whiz! We'll talk more about lang chain versus is lang chain dead, is it? Long live lang chain! I think we're getting some great questions in the chat. Keep them coming in cohort questions. If you guys have them throughout

381
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:32.690
Dr. Greg: the week, if you have them over the weekend. We're always here trying to get you up to speed

382
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.260
Dr. Greg: in terms of what is the latest from the Llm. Edge.

383
01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:58.359
Dr. Greg: Tomorrow you can join us to talk agent evaluation. Get out ahead of that a little bit for the cohort. We'll do it with Ragus. We're live on Youtube on Thursday. We'll talk lang chain with lang graph. We'll talk about the constructs. You need to know. We'll talk about how to take something like we built today and make it really production ready and production grade we hope you enjoyed today? We certainly did.

384
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:28.089
Dr. Greg: This is really the hard class to get over the hump. If you thought everything was easy. We got more advanced stuff coming. If you thought all of this was just way too much. This is the stuff that doesn't really change from here. So you just need to keep working on it. Just need to keep putting in time to get a handle on it. You will get up to speed, especially as you start submitting those homeworks. Keep building, shipping, and sharing everybody. Keep tagging at AI maker space. We'll see on Thursday lang chain session. 4.

385
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:35.639
Dr. Greg: Thanks for joining us for session 3. And to end rag. See, you guys soon have a fantastic evening and have an awesome week. Everybody

386
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.880
Dr. Greg: bye, guys.

387
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:43.430
Seraacha: Bye, everyone see you. Thursday.

388
01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.530
Dr. Greg: Bye, y'all, later.

389
01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.380
Seraacha: Bye.

390
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.999
Dr. Greg: Much load. Let's go.
