        "\n",
        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Recent variants of knowledge distillation include teaching\\nassistant distillation, curriculum distillation, mask distillation, and\\ndecoupling distillation, which aim to improve the performance of knowledge\\ndistillation by introducing additional components or by changing the learning\\nprocess. Teaching assistant distillation involves an intermediate model called\\nthe teaching assistant, while curriculum distillation follows a curriculum\\nsimilar to human education. Mask distillation focuses on transferring the\\nattention mechanism learned by the teacher, and decoupling distillation\\ndecouples the distillation loss from the task loss. Overall, these variants of\\nknowledge distillation have shown promising results in improving the\\nperformance of knowledge distillation.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-05-05\\nTitle: Spot-adaptive Knowledge Distillation\\nAuthors: Jie Song, Ying Chen, Jingwen Ye, Mingli Song\\nSummary: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a well established paradigm for\\ncompressing deep neural networks. The typical way of conducting knowledge\\ndistillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the\\nteacher network to harness the knowledge at one or multiple spots (i.e.,\\nlayers) in the teacher network. The distillation spots, once specified, will\\nnot change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation\\nprocess. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to\\ntraining samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation\\nstrategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the\\ndistillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training\\niteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on\\n\"where to distill\" instead of \"what to distill\" that is widely investigated by\\nmost existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation\\nmethods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10\\nstate-of-the-art distillers are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nSAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and\\nheterogeneous distillation settings. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/zju-vipa/spot-adaptive-pytorch\\n\\nPublished: 2020-11-30\\nTitle: A Selective Survey on Versatile Knowledge Distillation Paradigm for Neural Network Models\\nAuthors: Jeong-Hoe Ku, JiHun Oh, YoungYoon Lee, Gaurav Pooniwala, SangJeong Lee\\nSummary: This paper aims to provide a selective survey about knowledge\\ndistillation(KD) framework for researchers and practitioners to take advantage\\nof it for developing new optimized models in the deep neural network field. To\\nthis end, we give a brief overview of knowledge distillation and some related\\nworks including learning using privileged information(LUPI) and generalized\\ndistillation(GD). Even though knowledge distillation based on the\\nteacher-student architecture was initially devised as a model compression\\ntechnique, it has found versatile applications over various frameworks.\\n  In this paper, we review the characteristics of knowledge distillation from\\nthe hypothesis that the three important ingredients of knowledge distillation\\nare distilled knowledge and loss,teacher-student paradigm, and the distillation\\nprocess. In addition, we survey the versatility of the knowledge distillation\\nby studying its direct applications and its usage in combination with other\\ndeep learning paradigms. Finally we present some future works in knowledge\\ndistillation including explainable knowledge distillation where the analytical\\nanalysis of the performance gain is studied and the self-supervised learning\\nwhich is a hot research topic in deep learning community.', name='arxiv', id='a83262ab-42dd-492d-ab2b-4582b50f0a16', tool_call_id='call_bGURQqziaRVYruUenoHblgfQ')]\n",

It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and background information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or answer. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses because it has access to additional information from the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI systems. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can produce more informed and contextually appropriate outputs.\""

It achieves this by adding lightweight, trainable components to the existing model layers, rather than modifying the entire model. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and the GPU memory requirements, making it efficient for adapting large language models like GPT-3. LoRA maintains or even improves model performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, without increasing inference latency.

His work focuses on efficient deep learning methods, including quantization, sparsity, and low-bit inference. He is known for his contributions to making large AI models more accessible by reducing their resource requirements, enabling their use in specialized domains. [More about Tim Dettmers](https://timdettmers.com/about/).\\n\\n### Attention in Machine Learning\\nAttention mechanisms in machine learning are inspired by the human cognitive process of focusing selectively on certain parts of the input data. They are crucial in tasks like language translation, where understanding the relationships between different elements in a sequence is essential. Attention mechanisms allow models to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input, improving the performance of sequence-to-sequence models. This concept has become a fundamental component in various applications, particularly in natural language processing.

It involves creating input, instructional, and conversational prompts to minimize bias and improve the quality of AI outputs. This technique is crucial in various applications, including customer support, content generation, and data analysis. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that may require repeated prompting to achieve the desired results, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and cost savings ([Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/prompt-engineering), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prompt-engineering)).\n",

Over time, prompt engineering evolved with advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques. These developments have enhanced the capabilities of language models, making them more powerful, context-aware, and adaptable for a wide range of NLP applications. The introduction of attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning in 2017 further improved the controllability of prompt-engineered language models, allowing engineers to shape model behavior and address biases ([Promptly Substack](https://promptly.substack.com/p/a-journey-through-the-history-of), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)).\n",
