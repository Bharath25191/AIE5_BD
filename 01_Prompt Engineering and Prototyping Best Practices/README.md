### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE5 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE5/00_Setting Up Git/README.md)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested:
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested:
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested:

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?





<b>Q1  Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.</b>


<b><i>Chatbot</i></b>
Of course! Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs by organizing data and the code that works on that data into "objects."
Imagine you have a toy car. In object-oriented programming, this toy car would be an "object."
This object would have characteristics, like color, size, and speed, which we call "attributes" or "properties."
The object can also do things, like move forward, backward, or make a sound. These actions are called "methods" or "functions."
By using objects, we can create more complex programs by combining different objects that interact with each other.
So, in simple terms, object-oriented programming is like playing with different toys (objects) that have their own unique features and abilities, and we can make them work together to create something fun and useful!



<b>Evaluation:</b> 
I think the answer is very good.
But it does not list the ‚Äúreal benefit‚Äù of using OOPS, that class acts as a blue prints for various objects of the same type, say Person class.

<b>Q2 Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶</b>

Buckminsterfullerene is a type of fullerene with the formula C60. It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, and resembles a soccer ball. Each of its 60 carbon atoms is bonded to its three neighbors.
Buckminsterfullerene is a black solid that dissolves in hydrocarbon solvents to produce a violet solution. The substance was discovered in 1985 and has received intense study, although few real world applications have been found.
Molecules of buckminsterfullerene (or of fullerenes in general) are commonly nicknamed buckyballs.[3][4]
Occurrence Buckminsterfullerene is the most common naturally occurring fullerene. Small quantities of it can be found in soot.[5][6]
It also exists in space. Neutral C60 has been observed in planetary nebulae[7] and several types of star.[8] The ionised form, C60+, has been identified in the interstellar medium,[9] where it is the cause of several absorption features known as diffuse interstellar bands in the near-infrared.[10]

Of course! Buckminsterfullerene, also known as C60, is a type of fullerene with a soccer ball-like structure made of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It was discovered in 1985 and is commonly referred to as a "buckyball." While it dissolves in hydrocarbon solvents to form a violet solution, its real-world applications are limited despite intense study. Buckminsterfullerene is the most common naturally occurring fullerene, found in small quantities in soot and even in space, where it has been observed in planetary nebulae and various types of stars.

<b>Evaluation:</b> 
It does a very good job overall.
Misses out explaining about the ionized form and the absorption features of C60.
Consider the statement in the summary ‚ÄúWhile it dissolves in hydrocarbon solvents to form a violet solution, its real-world applications are limited despite intense study.‚Äù These are 2 different facts, but the LLM assumed causality between the two.

<b>Q3 Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.</b>

<b><i>Chatbot</i></b>
Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a lonely robot named Spark. Spark spent his days wandering the city, feeling lost and disconnected from the world around him. One day, while exploring a quiet park on the outskirts of the city, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten garden filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds.
As Spark marveled at the beauty of the garden, he noticed a small, curious squirrel watching him from a nearby tree. The squirrel, named Nutmeg, approached Spark cautiously but with a friendly smile. Despite their differences, Spark and Nutmeg quickly formed an unlikely friendship, spending their days exploring the garden and sharing stories of their adventures.
Through their friendship, Spark learned the true meaning of companionship and found joy in the simple moments shared with his new friend, Nutmeg. And so, in the most unexpected of places, a robot and a squirrel discovered the power of friendship and the beauty of connection in a world filled with endless possibilities.



Folloe up Q
Why is the garden unexpected place
Chatbot
That's a great question! Let's think about it together. Gardens are usually seen as peaceful and serene places, where one can relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. When something unexpected happens in a garden, it can catch us off guard because we associate gardens with tranquility and predictability. The contrast between the usual calmness of a garden and the unexpected event can make it stand out even more. It's like finding a surprise in a place where we least expect it, adding an element of excitement and intrigue to the experience. So, in a way, the unexpectedness of a garden can make it even more special and memorable.


From this response we can clearly see that the answer is not related to the previous Question we had asked.

<b>Evaluation:</b> 
It seems as if that the LLM‚Äôs temperature is ~ 0, as every time I ran this command,I got nearly the same response, with very few modifications, even the name of the squirrel seems to be the same across various runs. Such an application is not good in the real world, especially if the ask is to be imaginative. So, in my opinion the app is not up to the mark.
The story's dystopian theme seems to fit as it talks about a robot finding friendship.
There is no option to further customize the summary, indicating that the model is stateless, this is evident based on a follow up Q I asked the chatbot
Also, it does not retain memory of the previous question, stateless.

<b>Q4 If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?</b>

<b><i>Chatbot</i></b>
Of course! Let's break it down step by step.
To get exactly 12 apples, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples (3 packs x 4 apples per pack = 12 apples).
And to get exactly 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of oranges (3 packs x 3 oranges per pack = 9 oranges).
So, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.


<b>Evaluation:</b> 
The response is accurate and well articulated.
I noticed that in the APP prompt template we asked LLM to reason through its steps, and its evident from the response it gave here.
Vibe check: Passed
Aspects Tested: Reasoning


<b>Q5: Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYo! It‚Äôs Blaze, we met at the party, rings a bell? It was so cool I paid for everything, what a showoff I was‚Ä¶ Thanks dude, you chipped in and saved the day‚Ä¶ Imma pull off a stunt next time, definitely forgetting my wallet, what say?‚Äù</b>

<b><i>Chatbot</i></b>
Hello there,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Blaze, and we had the pleasure of meeting at the recent gathering. I trust that this introduction rings a bell and brings back memories of our encounter. Reflecting on the event, I must admit that I may have come across as a bit of a showoff by covering all expenses. Your kind gesture of contributing towards the expenses truly saved the day, and for that, I am sincerely grateful.
Looking ahead, I am inclined to reciprocate your generosity by planning a future outing where I may conveniently "forget" my wallet, allowing you the opportunity to step in and assist. I believe this playful exchange will add an element of fun to our interactions. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.
Warm regards, Blaze

<b>Evaluation:</b> 
Does a good job.
Changes party to gathering -> Overdoing the formal tone ? üòÄ
 I trust that this introduction rings a bell and brings back memories of our encounter. -> Definitely over stresses things.
